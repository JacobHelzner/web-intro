      <p1>Anyways,
      about me, I'm a nerdy college student (might have guessed that from context). My major is computer science
      and I hope to use it for stuff like making games in my free time (and also job stuff but who cares about that).
      I'm into a lot of stuff, but go through phases of being very interested in one thing. Last semeter I was
      really into playing old JRPGs like the snes Final Fantasies and Chrono Trigger, and spent a ton of time
      trying to figure out how to compose the perfect battle theme. I did a lot of work in Logic Pro using
      soundfonts! <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jacob-helzner/dramatic-battle-theme-really-old" style="color: #8ebf42">Here's a link.</a>. I am definitely a music person, I especially love stuff
      with funky and interesting harmonies, so jazz, certain types of electronica, ambient and of course video game
      music are totally my thing. Some other random things I like in no particular order: hacking old nintendo consoles, SCP Foundation, mysterious/lost games and other media, and urban exploration. Last summer
      I also played Undertale and Deltarune for the first time and absolutely fell in love with the characters,
      humor, atmosphere, art, Toby Fox' music etc. In fact I loved it so much I was desperate to find anything like it... I picked up Touhou for the bullet hell and musical aspects and have certainly been enjoying that (getting better at it every day). Unfortunately though, this desire to find things like Undertale would be my hubris, because I made
      the major mistake of selling my soul to Andrew Hussie for four months (in 2022 no less), over which I
      experienced the indescribable 2010's era period piece which is Homestuck. That's all I'll say about that,
      so as not to contribute to its memetic propogation, even though things are pretty much fizzled out by now (Also I did
      the SCP refrance, I made it hapen). Not gonna lie though, I absolutely loved it from beginning to end. <br><br>

      I guess that brings us to right now in the chronology of things. The wonderful art of that massive
      godforsaken webcomic was really the impetus for this whole learning how to draw thing. I hope I can figure it out,
      because it would be cool as hell to be able to just sit down and make something that looks half as good. Fingers
      crossed :) <br><br>

      Now that I got this site working, my goal for the next
      few days is to find a good self-paced tutorial/workbook (maybe a pdf?) on figure
      drawing. Hopefully update soon!</p1>
