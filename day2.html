      <p1> Title says it all. I randomly found a pdf of the how to draw manga book from the Homestuck.. even funnier is that the book actually looks good - theres step-by-step
      information on how to draw figures, which is exactly what I was looking for. This
      is too perfect haha. <img src="caliborn.png" width=100%
     height=100%> Also, I ran down to the bookstore and bought a sketchbook and some erasers which should hopefully work. I'm gonna use normal pencils, which I have a bunch of since I'm just starting out. Update soon with progress! My goal is to get through Chapter 1 by the end of the week! </p1>
