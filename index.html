      <p1tit>Hi! I'm Jacob. Welcome to the (hopefully) epic saga which will be this blog as I learn how
      to draw stuff. I basically just thought of doing this today so hopefully this project will take
      off as I periodically update. I'll post pictures of my progress and write about how I'm
      figuring this all out.<br><br> I'm super looking forward to this because I've always wanted to be able to
      draw my ideas for characters and fantasy places and creatures and such. Also, I make art stuff already,
      so learning how to draw seems somewhat less daunting. That said I might look back on this and be
      like "lmao this smug guy thinks it's gonna be so easy". Only one way to find out though! </p1tit>
